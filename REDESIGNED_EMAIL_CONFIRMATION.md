## 🚀 Technical Changes

### **Removed:**
```typescript
// ❌ Removed unnecessary polling
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    checkEmailConfirmation(); // No longer needed!
  }, 3000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### **Kept:**
```typescript
// ✅ Still saves pending data for future use
useEffect(() => {
  AsyncStorage.setItem(PENDING_USER_KEY, JSON.stringify({...}));
}, []);
```

### **Why No Polling?**
- ✅ Database trigger creates profile automatically
- ✅ User just needs to login after confirmation
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler, faster
- ✅ Less battery drain
- ✅ Better UX
